Before beginning, I'd like to contextualize exactly what this presentation is in relation to the paper that will result from it, and what I hope to achieve by presenting it. The project I'm working on essentially has two major components in terms of the work that will go into it. I want to talk about the way that circulation of materials and commodities, and more specifically the scale and type of circulation, affects the depiction of material in general in *Through the Arc of the Rain Forest*. This requires the kind of work that usually goes into literary analysis: a fair amount of focused close-reading to trace the way that material depictions change over the course of the novel combined with engagement with some of the theorists we've read over the course of the semester, including Bill Brown and Zygmunt Bauman. Alongside this work, though, I want to also do another kind of work, which is what I'll be presenting today: mapping. As I read Yamashita's novel the first time, and especially as I reread it to flag passages, character movements, and quotations, I realized that it is almost impossible to make sense of it without keeping a mental map of which characters were where, and which of the other characters they're with. The reading experience of the novel is, I think, such a strange one in part because of the difficulty of keeping this map straight. But on a higher level, the work the novel is doing, and the sophisticated relation I see it making between globalization and materiality, relies on this sense of increasing scale and multiple, coexisting temporalities of movement. Therefore, in both this presentation and the paper, much of the argument will be run through a visual, spatial representation of the novel as a drama of network expansion, both for communicative reasons---explaining the novel to someone who'd never read it would take longer than visually presenting the novel's use of space---and for analytic reasons.

Finally, there is a methodological question underlying this effort that is of interest to me and which I might like to address, using this paper as a starting point, in another, future paper. That question is: *What would a digital environmental humanities look like?* Mapping is an obvious place to begin purusing one: more and more geospatial data is being gathered and analyzed as a way of approaching issues in environmental studies more broadly. At the same time, the Digital Humanities and the Environmental Humanities are coming into their own, and definitional questions are still being widely posed for each. Generally speaking, I work in both fields, and at some point, I need to start thinking about how to make them work together. This admittedly modest exploration is a first step in that direction.

I'd love if this context could guide your feedback to what I'm about to present, but of course I'd really appreciate any thoughts you have. This could be taken as somewhere between a draft of a conference paper and a version of part of the paper I will turn in on the fifteenth. First I'm going to outline address some of the theoretical basis for what I'm looking at and how I see it playing out in the novel broadly. Then, I'm going to go into more detail with an excerpt from my analysis of Kazumasa's early sections, and in doing so I'll bring in some of the maps. So with that, I'll get to it.

#Introduction, or rather: Space, Things, Material

In Zygmunt Bauman's "Living (Occasionally Dying) in an Urban World," he presents a conception of space that is new, that has emerged with---and may be coextensive with---globalization and global capitalism. He defines his "the space of flows" **Slide** as the spatial dimension "where global powers reside and operate," in which 

>it is the *speed of movement and facility to escape*, not the size of *territorial possessions* (and so responsibilities), that count and decide.… New empires are not of this world---not of earthly, geographical world, not of the "space of places." (112)

[+1 sentence] Although his focus here is primarily on territoriality itself, his "space of flows" can also provide a way to discuss materiality in terms both of spatial understanding, and in the context of a global market. Is the international object, which is built in one place specifically to be shipped to and used in another, the same as the object used by the person who builds it, and used primarily where it was built? If territorial possession is anathema to global power, what about the possessions that [define the] territory? In Bauman's primarily geographical account of the space of flows, a more fundamental view of power and materiality remains unstated, but is nevertheless constitutive. Namely, that global power is greater the less it is constrained by materiality. Put another way: power can increase to a global scale only to the extent that it can operate independently of material limitations. 

Karen Tei Yamashita's *Through the Arc of the Rainforest* can be read as a surreal, comedic, but nonetheless sophisticated case study in a very similar principle. The relationship of global power and global capitalism to space is mirrored in the treatment of *things* that results from it. Narratively, these relationships express themselves in several ways. As you might expect, movement of characters in the usual sense occurs in the normal course of narration, which in this case follows a trend of centralization. But other kinds of movement also exist in the novel, in which characters themselves remain stationary but move *in absentia* through the circulation of commodities. In this kind of circulation, Yamashita's Bauman-esque view of territoriality comes into contact with her treatment of material *things*: the drive to scale up power and influence, often external to the characters' own wishes, causes them to lose sight of *things* as fundamentally material entities; this immateriality is dramatized in the novel's explosive conclusion. The characters begin to understand *things* instead in terms of exchange, movement, and *networks* of circulation. At the same time, this immaterial view of objects is accompanied by a kind of push-back from everything that is lost when the material substratum of exchange is ignored. The Matacão, almost a character itself, is the most obvious example: it's an underground, impenetrable mass of congealed plastic with magnetic or magical properties, and it results from the kind of waste-production that's only possible when you're ignoring (on a massive scale) the material basis of consumption. Elsewhere in the novel, materiality is associated with more basic (and implicitly more valued) social relationships. These relationships are most visible when they're lost, when the immaterial obsession has finally run its course. This continual back-and-forth---with market forces dematerializing everything on one hand and the material, natural basis of *things* reasserting itself in response---it boils down to an ethical stance on the novel's part, a stance that privileges *attention to materiality* over the immateriality of global circulation.

This is not a novel about things on their own, though, and the circulation of things can be obscured by the circulation of *people*, which predictably garners more focus. In fact, the circulations of things and people are more difficult to keep separate than would be the case in a less imaginative novel. The relationship between the two can be defined pretty much as follows: interaction of objects and people in a non-market sense often takes the form of something like prosthesis, and the prosthetic objects mediate the way people interact with markets, global circulation networks, and the power that comes with both. 

From the opening paragraph, the boundary between thing and person is destabilized through the many object-appendages that come close to defining each of the characters. As I said, for the purposes of this presentation, I'll be focusing on the example of Kazumasa and the ball floating in front of his forehead. A great deal of emphasis is placed, from the beginning, on the ball's material: it is made out of a plastic-like material, something similar to (or at least that reacts to) the stuff of the Matacão. Almost as much attention is given to how much it comes to define Kazumasa. Although it's fallen from the sky, it's attached itself to him permanently, so permanently that, by implication, the only way to take it from him is by killing him. It is not until Kazumasa grows up---enters the labor force, we might say---that his object-appendage begins to mediate his movement and economic relationships. When he does enter the labor force, his ball provides him a job specifically *because of its material peculiarity*. And because it starts to be attracted to weaknesses in railroad tracks, its peculiar nature also puts *Kazumasa* in motion. The effects of this are visible in the expanding size of his sphere of influence. Though the beginning of his life is narrowly confined to a scale consistent with the powers of his unaugmented body, 
[![Kazumasa initial network](http://prpole.github.io/images/1NetworkJapan0.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/1NetworkJapan0.jpeg)
the moment his abilities are extended by the object that is augmenting him---the moment, we might say, in which the ball becomes a prosthetic---the extent of his influence expands. 
[![Kazumasa's network expands](http://prpole.github.io/images/1NetworkJapan1.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/1NetworkJapan1.jpeg)
The geographic boundaries of his movement are carefully delineated to emphasize this increase: it is made very clear that he is traveling from Hokkaido, the northernmost portion of Japan, to Nagasaki, which is located in the south. 

But is Kazumasa put into motion or put into circulation? Now is a moment for some definitions. Circulation in the sense I'm using it here relies on exchange, and more specifically the exchange of commodities. And of course when I say commodity I mean specifically an object that is a product of labor, that is both used and exchanged. Kazumasa's ball is not a product of labor, and therefore the *ball* is not a commodity in itself. But something else is happening here in terms of the changing materiality of Kazumasa's self as a result of his prosthesis. The ball is his only way of performing the labor by which he supports himself, because it is the part of him that responds to the track weaknesses. In a sense unique to the novel, then, Kazumasa's labor power is externalized---objectified in the ball. Though the ball may not be a commodity in itself, it is in part a way of physicalizing Kazumasa's commodified labor power. 

I should pause to make clear that I'm not suggesting a reductive, allegorical reading of the ball as only (and entirely) commodified labor. (Lest we forget, the ball is also the narrator of the novel.) I'm just arguing that it acts as such in the way it mediates Kazumasa's economic relations. In other contexts, the ball is also something like an essence of his identity---at certain points he is just "The Japanese with the ball," it speaks for him more than he speaks for himself, and so forth. So although it's important not to overstate this reading, the place of the ball in between Kazumasa and the market is clear.

Understanding Kazumasa's ball as his labor power externalized can also add some useful context to the conditions of his increasing obsolescence as a railroad maintainer, especially as this obsolescence relates to the size of his sphere of influence. It's significant tat, when Kazumasa eventually loses his position with the railroad company, it is because a new, bigger company has taken over that *replicates his ball exactly* with a *mechanical device* (**cite**). With the ball understood as externalized labor power, the one-for-one replacement of human labor by its mechanical equivalent is imagined as the mechanical reproduction of an object. The result of this replacement is a decrease in the geographical extent of Kazumasa's influence. He is fired, which results a cut in pay and a major curtailment of the distance he travels per day: "**quote**" (**cite**). 
[![Kazumasa's network decreases](http://prpole.github.io/images/1NetworkJapan2.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/1NetworkJapan2.jpeg)
In the first place, a relationship is established here that persists throughout: geographic influence correlates with economic power, as seen here in that fact that a diminution of distance covered leads to a wage cut. But the mechanization of Kazumasa's ball has a further-reaching effect on Kazumasa himself. Just as his ball enters a larger system of essentially mechanical objects, Kazumasa himself becomes, to some extent, mechanical. His circulation in the system has a strict, regulated period, and the task has all the mindless repetition so characteristic of work within an extensive division of labor. A similar diminution of Kazumasa as an individual occurs later, when the ball has again been mass-produced, this time as a fashion accessory: "**quote**" (**cite**). In both cases, the characteristics of the ball's circulation in a larger system of objects determines the character of Kazumasa's own interaction with larger systems, whether those systems are economic, cultural, or social. It is no surprise that Kazumasa's diminishing status causes him to flee Japan for another locale: São Paulo.

#Still to Come

Kazumasa is an isolated case, and before I move on to briefly run through the rest of the maps I have so far, I'd like to outline what I plan to say about the rest of the characters in the full paper. I plan to argue that, unlike Kazumasa's case, in which the prosthetic object mediates his interaction with market situations but remains attached to him, the peculiar objects of many of the other characters extend their boundaries beyond the individual. Some of these boundaries are extended through trade: Mané Pena's feathers work as normal commodities; Chico Paco's pilgrimages lead to extension through a pilgrim network and radio show; Batista and Tania's pigeons go international; and J. B. Tweep's third arm, in a somewhat complicated swap, propel him to the head of GGG and therefore make him coextensive with the company's activity. Some of these extensions will be visible in the maps to come. In each case, though, a the radical extension of the self corresponds with the decreasing emphasis on materiality and finally, when each of these extensions crescendo simultaneously, the destruction of the objects at their center. One image will become central to these arguments: the GGG corporation's endless circulation despite having lost its object, the "card" or "microchip" that is both central to the company and entirely unnecessary to it. The company that needs to keep moving but doesn't have to *make* anything becomes a defining image of the relationship between global capitalism and material *things*. 

The way this all finally gets environmental---and I realize it's kind of a long walk, but it *is* where I'm getting to---is when GGG tries to turn the dematerializing power of globalization onto its own waste product, the Matacão. A self-digesting, or self-recycling capitalism is implicitly posited when commodities---*any* types of commodity---begin to be made out of Matacão. It is in theory a capitalist solution to the negative externalities of globalization: instead of the Matacão's migration to "virgin" territories, which stands in for trash dumping in impoverished parts of the world, production can just eat its own tail and turn into waste products. The novel's renunciation of this solution is spectacular: the world is engulfed in plague, flames, and violence. Finally, all the "development" of the early sections is undone in the "return," but only after extraordinary (if cartoonish) violence. The note the novel ends on *is* the destruction of congealed waste matter, but it is after the global market collapses---and collapses naturally. A naturalized version of market crisis, then, is in a certain sense considered ecologically in its give and take of material exchanges, but finally is unable to find a steady state and is rejected by the system.

#Maps: Narrative Structure and the Expansion of Circulation Networks

I'll get to the maps shortly, but as a final bit of context, it's worth drawing some attention to the way the chapters of the book are organized and the section titles they're placed under. **read from slide** Each of these sections is split into chapters focusing more or less on one of the major characters. About the simplest thing you can say regarding the progress of these narratives in terms of space is that each of the characters starts out in a different place, and they all eventually converge on the Matacão. I'll be focusing more on commodity circulation and other networks of exchange. The maps I'm about to show aim to demonstrate that the novel's narrative structure corresponds to a step-by-step increase in the scale of circulation marshaled by each character, and in some cases the centralization of those circulation networks into one larger one, just as the characters come together geographically on the Matacão. There are also some maps missing from the end, which I'm waiting to make until I'm sure they're necessary. Specifically missing are the (perhaps most important) ones that will represent different temporalities of movement—--the human, market, and geographical temporalities---as they relate to the ethics of materiality discussed above.

As a more specific solicitation for feedback, now that I've made these things, I'm trying to figure out how useful they are. For the time being, I'll just go through them with a few thoughts on each. So when we get to feedback later I'd love to hear if they helped people, or if not, and how they might be focused or improved.

[![Batista and Tania Aparecida Djapan's Pigeon Network](http://prpole.github.io/images/1PigeonNetworkSP0.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/1PigeonNetworkSP0.jpeg)
These are the city limits of São Paulo, with all the public transportation lines marked in black. In the center is the beginning of the pigeon network, starting with a single pigeon that is injured on the sidewalk. It's important to note that Batista's life changes dramatically due to his fixation on this first pigeon: his interests and routines are all mediated through it from the beginning.

[![A Single Pigeon Increases the Scale](http://prpole.github.io/images/1PigeonNetworkSP1.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/1PigeonNetworkSP1.jpeg)
When Tania tries to get rid of the pigeon, she only inadvertently increases its range and kicks off the expansion of the pigeon network. **read quote** At this point the combination of the pigeons status as a kind of appendage becomes also a type of circulation in that it establishes a circuit.

[![Pigeon Network Exceeds São Paulo](http://prpole.github.io/images/1PigeonNetworkSP2.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/1PigeonNetworkSP2.jpeg)
The pigeon goes further. The increase in network scale interestingly coincides with the training of a creature, linking up the physical capabilities of the animal with the extension of Batista's influence.

[![Chico Paco's first pilgrimage](http://prpole.github.io/images/1MovementBrazil1.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/1MovementBrazil1.jpeg)
About the same time, Chico Paco begins the pilgrimage to establish an altar to St. George on the Matacão. This is an example of individual movement rather than a circuit, until...

[![Trip Becomes Circuit](http://prpole.github.io/images/2Brazil0.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/2Brazil0.jpeg)
...the trip becomes a circuit in Part II. This is actually a mistake; Chico Paco's next trip is to São Paulo. Nevertheless, the beginning of the pattern of pilgrimages and returns establishes a kind of one-man circulation of prayer. This is especially so because his individual circulation is motivated by a larger network of communication and requests.

[![Pigeon Networks cover a whole region, get funding](http://prpole.github.io/images/2PigeonNet1.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/2PigeonNet1.jpeg)
**read quote** The funding here is important, as is the "test flight": this is not only no longer a one-pigeon operation, it is no longer a two-person operation. The increase in scale is now in two dimensions, between range and number of agents. Its increase will only, of course, continue. Moving into Part II involves an change in type as well as extent for both Chico Paco and Batista & Tania.

[![All Brazil Networks in Part II](http://prpole.github.io/images/2Brazil1_all.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/2Brazil1_all.jpeg)
Here are all the networks as of part two, plus J.B. Tweep's entrance. Note that the setting has stopped being individual, atomized towns, and has started being regions of Brazil. In Part II, we have moved from the local to the regional. 

[![Global networks, part i - part iii: before](http://prpole.github.io/images/3Networks0.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/3Networks0.jpeg)
Moving from Part II: The Developing World to Part III: More Development is a matter of moving from the regional to the national and, in the case of GGG, the international. Here is how things look when they begin, with GGG bound to productless circulation and containment and Batista and Tania limited to a single injured pigeon. But here... **slide**

[![Global networks...: after](http://prpole.github.io/images/3Networks1.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/3Networks1.jpeg)
Is what happens when other forces come into play. For GGG, it is the subsumption of Mané Pena's feather business and their development into commodities on top of the massive flow of capital to transform the Matacão into a base of operations. **read quote  on right**. The Pigeon network now covers a majority of the country, and on top of that has enough pigeons to necessitate a truck. **read quote on left** It has entered the public consciousness.

[![Pigeon network and pilgrim network combine](http://prpole.github.io/images/4Networks0.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/4Networks0.jpeg)
The pigeon network is now also combined with Chico Paco's emerging votive circuit, as Batista is accompanying Chico Paco in a truck. With Part IV: Loss of Innocence, networks start combining or being centralized into larger units, multiplying the scale of all of them.

[![Networks go international](http://prpole.github.io/images/4Networks1.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/4Networks1.jpeg)
But above all, the Loss of Innocence is characterized by the transgression of or extension to the limits of national borders. The Pigeon network surpasses GGG's network: **read quote**. Chico Paco's one-person pious mission is expanded into a many-person votive network of constant motion, with volunteers making pilgrimages all over the country. **read quote**

[![centralization](http://prpole.github.io/images/5Networks1_kazumasa-ggg-feather.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/5Networks1_kazumasa-ggg-feather.jpeg)
The continued loss of innocence is mainly defined by the centralization as well as the corruption of Kazumasa, arguably a kind of ethical paragon in terms of his pursuit of real happiness and his disdain for the kind of circulation he nevertheless finds himself within. His loss of innocence happens when he turns his ball to the search of profit and extraction of Matacao: **read quote, left then right**

[![GGG's global aspirations](http://prpole.github.io/images/5Networks2_kazumasa-ggg-feather.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/5Networks2_kazumasa-ggg-feather.jpeg)
Such minor internationalism is far short of any aspirations of globalism, however. GGG's own aspirations encompass the entire world: **read quote**

[![Pigeon network crosses the Atlantic](http://prpole.github.io/images/5NetworksWorld1_all.jpeg)](http://prpole.github.io/images/5NetworksWorld1_all.jpeg)
It is the Pigeon network that ends up coming closest to achieving this globality in Part V., though. **read quotes on right** Note that this coincides with the dismantling of the relationship between Batista and Tania, which from the beginning has also been a marker of innocence and lauded. Additionally, note that the global is presented here as something that exceeds comprehension. What is unable to be considered is here presented as undesirable, and globalism is one such thing. At the same time, Chico Paco's pilgrim network has been largely dematerialized further and turned into a radio show. This coincides with a distancing from his friend Gilberto, who has been marker of authentic relationships, and was the origin of Chico Paco's pilgrimages and holiness in the first place.


I have a couple more maps to do, but after this, as you know, everything collapses and returns to territory-based happiness, except where people die. The map I most want to exist is one that charts every movement beyond the extent of a city in terms of its speed as well as its magnitude. I think that in a sense the novel resolves on the contemplation of the geological timescale in terms of human activity.
