Phillip R. Polefrone is a PhD Candidate in Columbia University's Department of
English and Comparative Literature. His work focuses on twentieth-century
American fiction from an environmental humanities perspective, with particular
focuses on American Literary Naturalism and speculative fiction. His
dissertation, "Literary Naturalism and the Anthropocene," considers the
philosophical, historical, and scientific resonances between American Literary
Naturalism and the deep history of the Anthropocene as a concept. Covering
authors such as Frank Norris, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Jack London, this
dissertation discusses the central problems of ecocriticism in the Anthropocene
as they appear in naturalist fiction: among them the "species" concept as it
relates to human history, the place of human guidance in natural systems, and
the role of capitalism (especially finance) in determining the scale and
character of humanity's influence on the planet. Using these issues as the
basis for a reading of naturalist novels expands the range of texts that are
read as "Anthropocene fiction," but it also presents a new reading of an
important moment in American literary history, recasting many of the well known
features of the naturalist genre in terms set by an urgent contemporary
discourse. 

In addition to this more traditional written work, Phillip's work on the
digital humanities uses natural language processing in Python to develop and
employ distant reading methods. Most recently, he has been focused on improving
automated location extraction and geolocation, which makes it possible to bring
data extracted from literature into closer contact with environmental datasets
revolving around emissions, climate change, and environmental justice.
